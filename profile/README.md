## Purpose
DigiGuard is a ficticious organization created as part of a course project. Our group is currently enrolled at [CodeFellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) in the Cyber Security Engineering program with a schedule completion date of September 9, 2023.

## Problem Domain:

We have been contracted by our client company,Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net, to improve the cybersecurity processes and systems of their AWS Cloud resources with a focus on logging, monitoring and detection of adversarial activity on cloud infrastructure. The client has requested a demonstration of how Digi-Guard will be able to protect its cloud infrastructure.
