## Welcome to Digi-Guard, the PREMIER Cloud Security Management Group!

This Organization is for team DigiGuard's midterm group project for class Ops-401d8 in the IT Ops/Cybersecurity program at Code Fellows. First, there is an overview of the project scenario and summary of the problem domain. After that, our team members are listed with links to their individual LinkedIn profiles and GitHub repositories. Next is a link to the team's project management board in GitHub, followed by the presentation links. Finally. there are links to our project's three three repositories:

* Documentation: Contains all the documentation that is part of this project, including topographies, flowcharts, and the incident response plan and compliance documentation we wrote as part of the project client's solutions.
* Presentation: Contains a .pdf copy of the slide deck we used to present our solutions and a link to the final presentation video.
* Scripts: Contains a coding script that was written to automate the process of importing employee information into Microsoft Active Directory from a .csv file and use it to set up new user accounts.
